  ‚îú‚îÄ SERVER/               # Express server (routes, controllers, models)
  ‚îú‚îÄ public/               # Static assets

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16 and npm
- MongoDB connection string
- Cloudinary account (cloud name, API key/secret)
- Razorpay keys (for payments; optional if you skip payments locally)
- Mail transport (e.g., SMTP creds for Nodemailer)

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd StudyNotion
```

### 2) Install dependencies
- Root (client):
```bash
npm install
```
- Server:
```bash
cd SERVER
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3) Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in `SERVER/` with values like:
```
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URL=<your_mongodb_uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<cloud_name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<api_key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<api_secret>

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<key_id>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<key_secret>

MAIL_HOST=<smtp_host>
MAIL_PORT=<smtp_port>
MAIL_USER=<smtp_user>
MAIL_PASS=<smtp_pass>
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
Optionally, create a `.env` in the client root if you externalize API base URLs:
```
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### 4) Run locally
- Run client + server concurrently from the root:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Or run individually:
```bash
# client (root)
npm start
# server
cd SERVER
npm run dev
```
App: http://localhost:3000 ‚Ä¢ API: http://localhost:4000

## üß≠ Useful Scripts
Root `package.json`:
- `npm start` ‚Äì start React dev server
- `npm run build` ‚Äì production build of client
- `npm run dev` ‚Äì run client and server concurrently

SERVER `package.json`:
- `npm run dev` ‚Äì start Express with nodemon
- `npm start` ‚Äì start Express with Node

## üóÇÔ∏è Notable Directories

- Frontend (`src/`)
  - `components/common` ‚Äì Navbar, Footer, Buttons, Modals, etc.
  - `components/core` ‚Äì Auth, Dashboard, Catalog, Course, HomePage, ViewCourse
  - `pages` ‚Äì Route pages (Home, Catalog, CourseDetails, Dashboard, etc.)
  - `services` ‚Äì API client (`apiconnector.js`), operations (auth, profile, courses, payments)
  - `slices` ‚Äì Redux slices (auth, profile, cart, courses, viewCourse)
  - `utils` ‚Äì helpers (avg rating, constants, formatters)
- Backend (`SERVER/`)
  - `routes` ‚Äì Express routes (Auth, Profile, Course, Payments, Contact)
  - `controllers` ‚Äì Request handlers
  - `models` ‚Äì Mongoose models (User, Course, Section, SubSection, Rating, etc.)
  - `config` ‚Äì DB, Cloudinary, Razorpay config
  - `utils` ‚Äì Mail sender, image uploader, helpers
  - `mail/templates` ‚Äì Email templates

## üîê Authentication Flow (high level)
- JWT-based auth stored in cookies, protected routes via middleware
- Email verification and password reset handled via tokenized emails

## üí≥ Payments (Razorpay)
- Order creation on backend -> client checkout -> webhook/verification -> enrollment + email

## üì® Email
- Nodemailer sends transactional emails: verification, password updates, enrollment confirmations

## üß™ QA Notes
- Ensure `.env` is configured before running the server
- If you see CORS issues, verify `CLIENT_URL` and the allowed origins in `SERVER/index.js`
- For video playback in `ViewCourse`, confirm Cloudinary URLs are valid
